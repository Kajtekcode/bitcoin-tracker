# Bitcoin Price Tracker

A simple Python script that fetches and displays live Bitcoin prices using the CoinGecko API.

## Why I Built This
Hi, I’m Sam—33, selling my restaurant after 7 years to pivot into IT. I’m a 2nd-year Software Engineering student passionate about Bitcoin, AI, and trading algorithms. This is my first GitHub project, blending my curiosity about crypto with my new coding skills!

## How It Works
- Fetches Bitcoin’s USD price every 10 seconds.
- Uses the free CoinGecko API.
- Prints timestamped updates to the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-tracker.git`
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd bitcoin-tracker`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
4. Run it: `python bitcoin_tracker.py`

## Future Ideas
- Add a graph with `matplotlib`.
- Track multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Save prices to a file.

## Status
Work in progress—feedback welcome!
